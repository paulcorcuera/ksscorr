## Description

`ksscorr` is a [Stata](http://www.stata.com/) wrapper of the Julia executable provided in the [VarianceComponentsHDFE.jl](https://github.com/HighDimensionalEconLab/VarianceComponentsHDFE.jl) package. It works by calling `inshell` (see [here](https://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general/1667486-new-package-inshell-available-on-the-ssc) for more details about this command) and running the routine based on the Stata options provided. The output of the Julia routine will be printed in the Stata output and there is an option to add the output of the Julia routine to the current dataset. The output from the Julia routine is:

- An indicator of whether the observation belongs to the leave-out connected set.
- The statistical leverages, refered to as Pii. These can be used to construct leave-out variances of the outcome.
- Variables related to the bias-correction routine, refered in the paper as Bii.
- Extremely fast in terms of estimating the two-way fixed effects model. It uses an approximate Cholesky solver based on [Laplacians.jl](https://github.com/danspielman/Laplacians.jl).

####  Things to be aware of:

- `ksscorr` depends on the `inshell` package and you need to *manually* download and unzip the [Julia app](https://github.com/HighDimensionalEconLab/VarianceComponentsHDFE.jl/releases/tag/v0.2.1.8) based on your operating system. The path to the bin folder is a required argument in the `ksscorr` command.
- Hasn't been thoroughly tested yet in MacOS and Unix systems. Please post any issues in the Github page.

#### Future updates

- Add the postestimation inference (lincom) part of the Julia routine.

## Install:

As mentioned before, `ksscorr` depends on the `inshell` package. To install it, run the following lines:

```stata
* Install inshell 
ssc install inshell
```

You need to manually download and unzip the [Julia app](https://github.com/HighDimensionalEconLab/VarianceComponentsHDFE.jl/releases/tag/v0.2.1.8) based on your operating system. The path to the bin folder is a required argument in the `ksscorr` command.
